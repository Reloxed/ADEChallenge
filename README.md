## ADEChallenge
This project has been developed to solve the challenge proposed by Advanced Digital Experts S.L. during their selection process.

### Things to have in mind
- This solution is surely not the best for the problem. This is developed to show and prove my knowledge on Flutter, always being open to receive feedback to improve the project and knowing that there are better ways to do it.
- This project has been developed in a Windows machine and having an Android emulator and an Android mobile phone, so it will NOT work on iOS because it would need Firebase to be implemented v√≠a XCode and I don't warranty that the rest of the application will work on it since I could not test it.
- I have used the following specifications:
![Specs](https://i.ibb.co/FsN82mr/image.png)

I can assure that the app works on this environment. Please, try to test the app on those specifications.

- Lastly, but not less important, I really hope you like what I did and hope to work with you soon!
